# Sick Day

Sick Day was developed for the Do you WANNA Jam?! game jam on itch.io, marking my second game jam project.
The nine-day event revolved around the theme inside out. The game is a tower defense where players strategically
place white blood cells to defend the nucleus from waves of pathogens, earning DNA to place or upgrade cells.
It features 4 unique towers and 3 enemy types.

This project emphasized special effects, balancing, and difficulty curve implementation, resulting in a complete
and replayable game. It ranked 21st out of 153, 15th in "fun", and 4th in "art", with art by @simi_draws.
